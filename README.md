# Implementing TrafficSignNet, our CNN traffic sign classifier
We’ll discuss the concept of traffic sign classification and recognition, including the dataset we’ll be using to train our own custom traffic sign classifier.

Traffic sign classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road, including speed limit signs, yield signs, merge signs, etc. Being able to automatically recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”.

Traffic sign recognition is just one of the problems that computer vision and deep learning can solve.
### Installation and Setup
Todo
### Result
As you can see, our traffic sign classifier is correctly recognizing our input traffic signs!
